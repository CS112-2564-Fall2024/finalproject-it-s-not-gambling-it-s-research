This Project between Connor and Kyle was a small game of roulette for users. 
We came together in hopes of making a functioning and expandable roulette simulator. The inspiration came to each 
of us from spending some time in casinos where creating that game of chance without the risk of financial loss 
could be a fun experience in the creation and for users. We hope you enjoy out attempt at capturing this 
moment of excitement. This game , like our time coding, is not a fully realized product; it is a step in a 
never ending strive towards improvement.
